                <p class="">Not being able to see the forest for the trees isn’t just a colloquialism
                    for Mihai Nita — it’s a professional disadvantage.</p>
                <p class="">“When I go into the forest, I can only see 100 meters around me,” said
                    Dr. Nita, a forest engineer at Transylvania University of Brasov, in Romania.</p>
                <p class="">Dr. Nita’s research interest — the history of Eastern Europe’s forests —
                    depends on a vaster, and more removed, vantage than eyes can provide.</p>
                <p class="">“You have to see what happened in the ’50s, or even a century ago,” Dr.
                    Nita said. “We needed an eye in the sky.”</p>

                <p class="">To map a landscape’s history, foresters like Dr. Nita long depended
                    on maps and traditional tree inventories that could be riddled with inaccuracies. But now they
                    have a bird’s-eye view that is the product of a 20th century American spy program: the Corona
                    project, which launched classified satellites in the 1960s and ’70s to peer down at the secrets
                    of the Soviet military. In the process, these orbiting observers gathered approximately <a

                <p class="">Even though they’re static, the panoramic photos contain discernible
                    imprints — penguin colonies in Antarctica, termite mounds in Africa and cattle grazing trails in
                    Central Asia — that reveal the dynamic lives of earthly inhabitants below. “It’s Google Earth in
                    black and white,” said Catalina Munteanu, a biogeographer at Humboldt University of Berlin who
                    has used Corona images to show that marmots returned to the same burrows throughout decades of
                    destructive agricultural practices in Kazakhstan.</p>

                    four, at most — and many offer less-detailed resolution than the photographs recorded by Corona.

                <p class="">More important, with the spy satellites, scientists can extend a

                    fluctuating boundaries of Nepal’s Phewa Lake over time. Then, the researchers predicted what could
                    come next, estimating that the shrinking lake could lose 80 percent of its water within the next 110
                    years. A loss of that magnitude would devastate the lake’s ability to supply water for
                    hydroelectricity generation, irrigation and tourism activities that hundreds of thousands of people
                    in Nepal rely on, they noted.</p>
                <p class="">“We can use imagery in the past to inform the future,” said C. Scott

                <h2>Images that kept the Cold War cold</h2>
                <p class="">Early in the Cold War, the United States struggled to acquire
                    military intelligence on the Soviet Union — a vast enemy spanning 11 time zones and one-sixth of the
                    planet’s land surface.</p>

                <p class="">Satellite reconnaissance offered a glimpse into the Soviet black box,
                    said James David, a curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. “Photo
                    intelligence tells you where the enemy’s military forces are,” he said. “It can go a long way in
                    telling you what equipment they have and what their state of readiness is.”</p>
                <p class="">One early answer was Corona, approved by President Eisenhower in
                    1958. But to photograph the enemy from space, U.S. officials first had to accomplish feats of
                    engineering: developing film that could withstand space radiation and air pressure, and then be
                    retrieved, developed and carefully analyzed.</p>
                <p class="">The first dozen attempted launches of Corona satellites <a
                        href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/corona.pdf"
                        title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flopped</a>, according to the C.I.A. Some of
                    the vehicles didn’t make it to orbit or back down, and others experienced camera or film mishaps.

                <p class="">Then, in August 1960, the first successful Corona flight made eight
                    daytime passes over the Soviet Union. When the camera had used all 20 pounds of its film, the
                    satellite released its film return capsule from a 100-mile altitude. The package hit the
                    atmosphere, deployed a parachute and was scooped up, midair, by an Air Force plane northwest of
                    Hawaii. It became the first photography ever recovered from orbit.</p>
                <p class="">“They had no idea if these systems would work,” said Compton Tucker,

                    was decommissioned in 1972 in favor of satellites that could beam their imagery back to Earth in
                    digital format.</p>
                <p class="">When, in 1995, the spy program’s archival images were declassified,
                    some appeared on the <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1995/02/25/issue.html"

                <p class="">Since then, the program has remained relatively unknown to the
                    public. “It’s the best military, taxpayer-funded success that no one knows about,” said Jason Ur, a Harvard University archaeologist who regularly depends on Corona images for his research.

                <p class="">One reason for their relative obscurity is that scientists who wanted
                    to use the images have needed to overcome a variety of obstacles. For example, while the pictures have been declassified, it costs researchers $30 to digitize a single image. Dr. Radeloff said there are “gobs and gobs of data,” but that most images are “still rolled in film and have not yet been
                    scanned.”</p>

                <h2>‘Like a time machine’ for Earth’s surface</h2>

                <p class="">Once wrangled, Corona’s spy photos can uncover a landscape’s history
                    beyond the contemporary era of widespread satellite imaging.</p>
                <p class="">Often, Corona’s ’60s-era snapshots captured habitats before humans
                    dramatically inundated, paved over, plowed up or developed wild spaces into new cities,
                    hydroelectric dams, farmland or industrial zones. The images even challenged our assumptions
                    about untouched ecosystems — revealing, more than <a

                        title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once</a>, that presumed old-growth
                    forests are actually younger than 70 years old.</p>
                <p class="">“In a lot of cases, they lead us to landscapes that are gone, that
                    don’t exist anymore” Dr. Ur said. “Corona is like a time machine for us.”</p>
                <p class="">In 2013, Kevin Leempoel, a biologist, set out to retrace the
                    historical boundaries of mangroves in Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve in China’s
                    south. Records were spotty before the 1980s, when global satellites began regularly documenting
                    the planet’s surface from space. “There was this big gap — we didn’t really have any other time
                    point,” said Dr. Leempoel, now with Britain’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>
                <p class="">By examining black-and-white Corona images and marking the forest’s
                    outline by hand, Dr. Leempoel <a
                        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258758072_Spatial_heterogeneity_in_mangroves_assessed_by_GeoEye-1_satellite_data_a_case-study_in_Zhanjiang_Mangrove_National_Nature_Reserve_ZMNNR_China"
                        title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demonstrated in 2013</a> that human
                    activity had driven mangrove cover down by more than a third from 1967 to 2009. That kind of
                    finding would have been impossible without the historical photos, he said.</p>
                <p class="">“In ecology, we’re all faced with the same issue: We start to have
                    good data in the ’80s or ’90s at best,” Dr. Leempoel said. “The difference between today and
                    then is not huge. But compared to a century ago, the difference is gigantic.”</p>
                <p class="">Still, Corona data remains relatively untapped by scientists. Only 5
                    percent — about 90,000 images out of 1.8 million total — of the country’s ever-growing backlog
                    of declassified spy satellite photography has been scanned so far, said Dr. Radeloff. “It hasn’t
                    been used that much yet. We’re at a cusp,” he said.</p>
                <p class="">With climate change and other global ecosystem transformations, it’s
                    never been more important to record and piece together long-term environmental timelines, Dr.
                    Munteanu said: “Everything we do leaves a footprint. That impact might only show up decades
                    later.”</p>
