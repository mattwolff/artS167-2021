                Fractional odds are a common occurence in the betting industry especially in the US and UK areas. Fractional odds, as seen above, are in the format of !/*, where * is the investment amount and ! is the amount of profit to be made. So say Hamilton has 11/9 odds to win the Budapest GP. If someone puts in $9 at those odds, and Hamiton wins the GP, they would win $9 + $11 (profit) for a total of $20. Rich boi!
